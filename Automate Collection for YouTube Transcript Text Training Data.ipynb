       "\"I have to tell y'all in college I had anickname it was the dirty does in themiddle of the day for no reason[Music]I can't think of anywhere I would ratherbe than here at the headquarters of tipstreats cooking delivery we love thisspace we get to that we had a reallysmall office you just celebrated openingyour 40th location that is a really bigmilestone where did this journeys beginwith Arden in 1999 when we were Collegesophomores at University of Texas by nowwonderful life here stood me up on adate actuallylike an interesting story do tellsure I was out with friends and myactivity ran long and then I didn't callme on to tell him I wasn't gonna make itfor the date that we had planned I wasstaying at my mom's and she said wellthat was very rude you should dosomething to apologize and so I used tobake cookies for funand so that was my apology I baked him aset of cookies and I drove him over tohis house and then when I got there theywere still warm and he looked at him andhe said we're gonna do this like pizzadelivery we're gonna have a business wecan run it right out of my apartment andthey'll be just like pizza deliveryexcept we're gonna deliver one cookieand TIFF immediately said no I reallythought that was that maybe 45 minuteslater she calls me and she says I'llgive it a try she made me promise thatwe could only do it as a business if wedid it Sunday through Thursday 8:00 p.m.to midnight because we were studentsduring the weekday and she wanted to goout with our friends all your prioritiesthree or nineteen so worth it we startedin January of 99 and I think we wentthree days where we had the batchesready we put flyers at dorms slid themunderneath dorm rooms put them on carsor on campus and we thought okay we'llsit back and we'll wait the orders willpour in and literally nothing for threedays yeah but three days it's not thatlong to wait I still remember our firstorder a girl named Amy from Universitytowers don't know don't know where sheis today they may be out there yeah we'dlove to connect with you Amy yes in factI think she called during a day when weweren't Oprah and she said I'd like toget an order for tonight left thevoicemail and Leon called me right awaysaid we've got an order right there mustbe one of your friends you knowwhich is your friend Amy not a friendthat's a real customer and so we wereexcited so Leon made that very firstdelivery to University towers dormthat's kind of how we started dormsapartments in West Campus yeah used tobe five orders a night would be plentybusy we were just hanging out in ourapartment we would make the dough duringthe day we'd have chocolate chips andM&M and we'd have all those chips in mysock drawer in my bedroomit took the socks out you take suctionand it was clean sock it's a clean socktour right and so if you call then placean order we go into my bedroom open thesock drawer out and get a bag ofchocolate chips and a bag of M&Ms go tothe kitchen and mix it into the doughand that's literally how small we werewhen we first started we startedskipping classes to deliver cookiesduring the data to the offices downtownand so we decided hey let's try to makethis thing not just a late-night cookiedelivery concept we think there's ademand for the law firms hospitalsdowntown officers did you realize youwere creating this social phenomenonlike what people when tip Street showsup in an office people go wild I mean Ihave chased a tip streets deliveryperson before and I know I'm not alonein that did you realize they would touchon him that way certainly we didn'trealize that when we started but I willsay people were excited about it fromthe get-go people always ask us and wetalked about a couple years after wegraduated college we went full-time weweren't making any money and we'reworking crazy hours and they say wellwhy didn't you want to quit and thetruth is we never considered quittingand the reason was because the communitywas so excited about what we were doingthat it would have seemed very odd to belike well never mind even thougheverybody loves it we're just you knowwe're not making enough money we're notgonna do it and so you know we made itwork and that excitement was there andit was building yeah every othervariable said we should have quit theonly thing that kept us going waseverybody was just so excited about yourheart wasn't it and so it was theirswhat's the most magical delivery you'veever been a part of early on we startedrealizing that what made us work is thatwe were connecting people in specialmoments there was a little boy in Planoand he had been diagnosed with cancer hewas going through chemo and the way weknew about that was his grandparentswere putting in an order for him andevery week they would count down howmany sessions left so they would startin 6 left and then the next week anotherwoman come in five left four left andthe staff of the store just noticed thisweek after week these orders comingthrough and so they finally get down toone and they send it out and then theydon't know and so they actually justcalled the family we've all been rootingfor him we want to know how he's doingand we're just going to pass along ourthoughts and they were surprised theydidn't realize that we would have evennoticed that the whole team was just soexcited to hear that he was doing wellhe had gotten through all of his chemosin remission and we were just so excitedto just be a part of it just be a partof something uplifting that it's such aspecial story yeah you've seentremendous amount of growth over thelast year's what do you think one of thebiggest factors of y'all successes wejust have that unique opportunity toreally be a part of somebody's momentthat privilege really it's connectpeople together so you can connect withsomeone thousands of miles away we'vehad a soldiers order for their lovedones here at home what do you think theSouth Warren College version of you twowould say about who you become now whatdo you think they would look at this andthey probably think we were boringthat's true cuz we don't go out everyFriday and Saturday night anymore that'sfor sure I think the sophomore would bekind of happy because I had interned myfreshman and sophomore years I remembersitting there watching everybody tickdown the clock at 4:45 4:50 waiting forfive o'clock to happen and they couldnot wait as soon as five o'clockhappened they were the happiest butthey're miserable the rest of the dayand so I remember sitting there thinkingI'm going to school to be a businessmajor and is this gonna be my life andso I definitely wanted to try to make itto where I was not one of those peoplejust waiting for the clock watching theclock and so hopefully my 19 year oldself would be kind of happy that it'snot that way we enjoy being here everysingle day and what does the future holdit's gonna be sensible a tip is her nameis on the box her name is on the signshe's not gonna allow the quality to dipat all so we'll grow as fast as we canwhile maintaining the kind of qualitythat and services there is justsomething about a tip streets cookie wemay never know the recipes but as longas I can just feed as many as possibleabout it's early but I think we canwherever that I actually think we havesome deliveries coming oh here we goyeah we dothanks Jen thank you see just this boxmakes people light up what were youthinking when you planned on the whitewith the blue ribbon the first thing wedid was look up on the internet how canwe package them and then it was actuallymy idea over here mr. ribbon my onecontribution great so when you designthis was it meant to be untied or do youdo what I do and just get it off andstuff you know and I think far and awayat the untie oh that's right in our ownadventure let me do the wrap I need toget a new nickname other than dirtydoesn't live up to that nickname righthere right now that's right a challengethey're so beautiful these are chocolatechip
